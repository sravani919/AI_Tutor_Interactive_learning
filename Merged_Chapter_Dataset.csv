"1.3 The Internet, Cloud Computing, and the Internet of Things","The internet was initially rooted in government and military applications. Advances in technology such as HTML, URL, and DNS made the internet more accessible to the average user.  Programs such as Zoom, Google Docs, and X (Twitter) foster new types of interactions between businesses and their customers. Through sites such as eBay and Amazon, e-commerce has become an efficient way to purchase products and services, not just from companies but also from individuals. Cloud computing refers to storing IT resources on a virtual server rather than on the actual computers where the resources are used.  The use of cloud computing in the workplace has increased productivity and saved money for many businesses.  Cloud computing enables individuals to access a wide variety of resources such as media files, documents, and photos without the need for computers with massive storage capacities.

10.1 Data Tables and Ranges,"Data Tables can be used for automatically generating multiple possible scenarios. This can be used to predict future outcomes, such as revenues, unit sales projections, installment payments, interest rate changes, and many other variables. Businesses need to construct complex datasets for their everyday control and management of the company. For that purpose, Excel has data ranges, which help the user define a name for a particular set of cells. This allows the user to use the given name of the data range instead of cell references. Arrays also simplify the complexity of huge worksheets, as they let the user autofill and compute multiple calculations simultaneously.","[' What is the purpose of data tables in Excel?', ' What is the difference between a data range and a data table?', 'What is an array in Excel and how does it simplify the complexity of huge worksheets?', ' How can data tables be used for predicting future outcomes?', 'What are some practical applications of data tables in business management?']","[' The purpose of data tables in Excel is to automatically generate multiple possible scenarios, which can be used to predict future outcomes, such as revenues, unit sales projections, installment payments, interest rate changes, and many other variables.', ' A data range is a set of cells in Excel that have been given a name, allowing the user to use the given name of the data range instead of cell references. A data table, on the other hand, is a set of data ranges that are organized in a way that makes it easy to compare different sets of data.', ' An array in Excel is a set of cells that are grouped together and can be used to perform calculations on multiple cells at once. This is done by entering an array formula in one cell and then copying or filling it down or across to apply the formula to all the cells in the array. The advantage of using arrays is that they simplify the complexity of huge worksheets by allowing the user to autofill and compute multiple calculations simultaneously.', 'Data tables can be used for predicting future outcomes by creating a table of scenarios based on the current state of the business. These scenarios can then be used to make predictions about future outcomes based on the current state of the business.', ' Data tables in business management have numerous practical applications. For example, they can be used to predict future revenues based on current sales trends, to plan for future installment payments based on current creditworthiness, or to monitor the performance of different products or services over time. They can also be used to compare the performance of different business strategies or policies.']"
10.2 More About Formulas," Businesses need spreadsheets to handle datasets that are updated every minute with information. Cell references, comparison operators, and array formulas can help analyze large sets of changing data.  Complex equations need complex formulas to solve them. Excel formulas use the same math symbols as pencil and paper math and follow the same order of operations. An easy way to remember the order of operations is with the acronym PEMDAS.  Cell references are needed in formulas and in constructing autofilled tables. There are three types of cell references: relative, absolute, and mixed. Relative cell references are when a cell copies its links to other cells relative to where it is located. Absolute cell references lock a reference to a specific cell, row, or column. Mixed cell references use both.  Comparison operators are math inequalities used in Excel formulas. They use logical operators like the IF function to make your workbook pull information for you.

Many logical functions can be embedded within one another to create complex logical scenarios.","[' What are the arithmetic functions in Excel?', ' What are the statistical functions in Excel?', 'What are the logical functions in Excel?']","[' Arithmetic functions in Excel include ADD, DIVIDE, MULTIPLY, SUBTRACT, and others.', 'Statistical functions in Excel include AVERAGE, COUNT, MAX, MIN, MEDIAN, MODE, STDEV, and others.', 'Logical functions in Excel include AND, IF, IFERROR, NOT, OR, and others.']"
10.4 PivotTables,"Corporations need to analyze their datasets to produce metrics or insights. However, these datasets need to be organized and cleaned before they can be processed. A PivotTable is a tool that reads raw datasets. It has user-friendly drag-and-drop capabilities that can help organize the table information for the business. These PivotTables are malleable, as the user can rearrange the variables in different ways to generate entirely different data highlights.  Visual representations of PivotTables can be generated using another Excel tool, PivotChart.","[' What is the purpose of a PivotTable?', 'How can a PivotTable help with data organization and cleaning?', ' What are some features of a PivotTable that make it malleable?', 'What tool can be used to generate visual representations of PivotTables?', 'What is the difference between a PivotTable and a PivotChart?']","[' The purpose of a PivotTable is to summarize and analyze data in a dataset.', 'A PivotTable can help with data organization and cleaning by organizing data into rows, columns, and cells, and calculating summary statistics.', 'Some features of a PivotTable that make it malleable include the ability to rearrange the variables in different ways to generate entirely different data highlights.', ' A PivotChart can be used to generate visual representations of PivotTables.', 'The difference between a PivotTable and a PivotChart is that a PivotTable provides summary statistics and data summaries, while a PivotChart provides graphical representations of the data.']"
