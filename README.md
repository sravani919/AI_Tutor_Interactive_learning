# AI Tutor ‚Äì Interactive Learning System

**Transforming traditional textbook content into adaptive, engaging, and intelligent learning experiences**

---

## üìò Project Overview

This AI-powered tutor transforms the *Workplace Software and Skills* textbook into a fully interactive, chapter-wise learning experience. Instead of passive reading, learners can engage in storytelling, business scenarios, gamified quizzes, and more‚Äîpowered entirely by AI models.

This project demonstrates how AI can revolutionize education by offering dynamic learning paths, real-time feedback, and cognitive engagement using large-scale models, without requiring manual curation of content.

## üöÄ Live Demo

> ‚úÖ [Launch on Google Colab (Public)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/sravani919/AI_Tutor_Interactive_learning/blob/main/latestcoding.ipynb)

**Note:**  
Deployment is in progress. Advanced models like Mistral-7B currently run locally on high-performance compute clusters. The public version on Colab is fully functional with most learning modes available for exploration.

## üìö Dataset Generation Pipeline

To support intelligent interactivity, a custom dataset was automatically generated from a 1000+ page PDF textbook:

1. **PDF Text Extraction:**  
   Used `PyMuPDF` to extract raw text and split into chapters.

2. **LLM-Based Question and Summary Generation:**  
   Applied `DeepSeek Coder 6.7B` locally to generate:
   - 5+ questions per chapter
   - Chapter summaries  
   Token usage was optimized with timeout handling and max-length constraints.

3. **Exporting Dataset:**  
   Final outputs were saved as JSON and consolidated into a `Merged_Chapter_Dataset.csv` for use by the AI tutor.
